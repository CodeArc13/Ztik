Random EverQuest pet name generator for Discord servers.
Runs from Repl.it, needs pinging every 30 mins to keep alive with somthing like uptimerobot.com
Also needs .env file containing DISCORD_BOT_SECRET=<SECRET_BOT_TOKEN> from the discord dev bot site.
Needs to have a higher role than the users wanting to have their nick names randomized.
Cannot change nickname of server owner unfortunately due to discord permissions.
Work arround is to have a user account for general use and a second admin/owner account.
